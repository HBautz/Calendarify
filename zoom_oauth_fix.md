# Zoom OAuth "Stuck After Login" Fix Guide

## üö® **The Problem**
Zoom OAuth flow gets stuck after user enters credentials on Zoom's login page. The user is never redirected back to your application.

## üîç **Root Causes**
1. **OAuth App in Development Mode** - Most common cause
2. **Redirect URI Mismatch** - URI must match exactly
3. **Missing OAuth Scopes** - App needs proper permissions
4. **OAuth App Not Activated** - App needs to be published

## üõ†Ô∏è **Step-by-Step Fix**

### 1. Check Zoom OAuth App Status
Go to [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/) ‚Üí Manage ‚Üí Build App ‚Üí OAuth

**Critical Settings:**
- ‚úÖ **App Status**: Must be "Published" (not "Development")
- ‚úÖ **Redirect URL**: Must be exactly `http://localhost:3001/api/integrations/zoom/callback`
- ‚úÖ **OAuth Scopes**: Must include `meeting:write` and `user:read`

### 2. OAuth App Configuration
```
App Type: OAuth
Redirect URL: http://localhost:3001/api/integrations/zoom/callback
Scopes: meeting:write, user:read
```

### 3. Development vs Production
**If your app is in "Development" mode:**
- Only the app owner can use it
- Limited to 100 users
- May have redirect restrictions

**Solution:** Publish the app or add your email as an authorized user

### 4. Add Authorized Users (Development Mode)
If keeping in development mode:
1. Go to your OAuth app settings
2. Add your email address to "Authorized Users"
3. This allows you to test the OAuth flow

### 5. Verify Redirect URI
The redirect URI in your Zoom app settings must match EXACTLY:
```
http://localhost:3001/api/integrations/zoom/callback
```
- No trailing slashes
- No extra spaces
- Case sensitive

### 6. Test with Manual OAuth URL
Use this URL to test the OAuth flow manually:
```
https://zoom.us/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=vfWc8HYwRtGyp7BwG8zCeQ&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3001%2Fapi%2Fintegrations%2Fzoom%2Fcallback
```

## üîß **Alternative Solutions**

### Option 1: Use Server-to-Server OAuth
If OAuth continues to fail, consider switching to Server-to-Server OAuth:
1. Create a new "Server-to-Server OAuth" app
2. Use Account ID instead of user OAuth
3. No redirect URI needed

### Option 2: Use Zoom Webhook
For meeting creation, consider using Zoom Webhooks instead of OAuth.

## üß™ **Testing Steps**

1. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
2. **Try incognito/private browsing mode**
3. **Test with different browsers**
4. **Check browser console for errors**
5. **Verify backend is running on port 3001**

## üìã **Checklist**

- [ ] OAuth app is "Published" (not "Development")
- [ ] Redirect URI matches exactly
- [ ] OAuth scopes are configured
- [ ] Your email is added to authorized users (if in dev mode)
- [ ] Backend is running on port 3001
- [ ] No browser cache/cookie issues

## üÜò **If Still Not Working**

1. **Check Zoom App Marketplace logs** for any errors
2. **Try creating a new OAuth app** with fresh credentials
3. **Contact Zoom Developer Support** if the issue persists
4. **Consider using a different integration method**
