# Calendarify

Calendarify is a **demo** Calendly clone. The repository started with static
marketing pages and now features a more complete React frontend built with
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and Tailwind CSS. The React app includes pages for
product features, pricing, authentication and a simple dashboard. All pages are
demonstration only and do not implement real scheduling functionality.

## Running the React app

```bash
cd web
npm install       # install dependencies
npm run dev       # start Vite development server
```

Additional scripts:

```bash
npm run build     # build production files into web/dist
npm run preview   # preview the production build
```
